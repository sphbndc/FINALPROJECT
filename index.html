                        <img src="cybersecurity.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image 1">
                        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from
                            digital attacks and unauthorized access. It involves using various technologies,
                            processes, and policies to safeguard digital assets and ensure the confidentiality,
                            integrity, and availability of information. Essentially, it's about keeping the
                            "cyber" world safe from malicious actors and threats. </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Cybersecurity VS Security</h3>
                        <img src="what-is-cybersecurity.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image 2">
                        <p>Cybersecurity is a subset of information security, focused on protecting digital
                            information and systems from cyber threats. Information security encompasses the
                            broader protection of all forms of information, both digital and physical,
                            including intellectual property. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 mb-4">
                        <h3>VPN as Cybersecurity</h3>
                        <img src="cybersecurity1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image 3">
                        <p>A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, creates a secure and encrypted connection over a
                            public network, like the internet, allowing users to access private networks and
                            protect their online activity. It essentially masks your IP address and encrypts your
                            data, making it more difficult for others to track your online activity or access your
                            sensitive information. </p>

                        <h3>People behind Cybersecurities</h3>
                        <img src="cybersecurity 2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image 4">
                        <p>A Cybersecurity Specialist is an IT professional focused on protecting computer systems
                            and networks from cyber threats. They achieve this by implementing security measures,
                            monitoring systems for vulnerabilities, and responding to security incidents.
                            Essentially, they safeguard an organization's digital assets from unauthorized access,
                            damage, or loss. </p>

                        <h3>Cybersecurity's Future</h3>
                        <img src="cybersecurity 3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image 5">
                        <p>Cybersecurity is critical to the tech industry as it impacts the innovation and
                            strategy of companies. Cyber attacks can lead to the loss of sensitive data,
                            financial losses, and damage to a company’s reputation. With the increasing dependence
                            on technology and the internet, it’s essential for companies to have robust
                            cybersecurity measures in place to protect their assets and customers. Adequate
                            cybersecurity allows companies to innovate and operate with confidence knowing that
                            their intellectual property and customer data is secure.</p>
